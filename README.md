## Heya!!

### My name is Emma LeBouef and I am currently a student at Tulane University. I am studying economics while concurrently pursuing my masters of Data Analytics. 
  - Last semester I took Introduction to Data Science with Prof. Mattei and I am excited to continue growing in my Python Skills and sythesizing hard comp sci skills with qualitative methods used in data analytics.
  - Lately, I've been super interested in  🏎️ Formula One racing 🏎️  and would love the opportunity to pursue further comp sci projects related to the field. 
### Fun Fact! 
  - 🦈 Sharks 🦈  are my favorite animal and I have collected shark teeth my entire life. I'm currently up to 800 and am hoping to breach the 1000 mark this summer!
